Above are all of my machine learning algorithms that have been used for cognitive state detection using specific derived features extracted from human brain wave oscillations.

Each model focuses on using a subject database that is unavailable to the public domain.

The models focus on using an All-for-One approach for categorizing each cognitive state while also incorpaorating a subject-by-subject k-fold.
